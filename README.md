# Lab5-Auto
Test cases to grade Lab 5 Automatically

This lab focuses on implementation of ArrayLists, LinkedLists and their Iterators

## GradTAExmaple Folder
Example from Grad TA

## JUnitTest Folder
Attempt to use JUnitTest for auto grading

Dependencies: [JUnit4](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/junit/junit/4.12), [Java hamcrest 2.0.0.0](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.hamcrest/java-hamcrest/2.0.0.0) (Included in this folder)

To use autograding, place the student's submission of `URArrayList.java` and `URLinkedList.java` in this folder, then run the autograding script while the folder is your working directory

### UNIX:
1. Change directory (`cd`) to the JUnitTest folder

2. Copy/Move student submission to the folder

3. `./autograde.sh`

*Note:* If your terminal says permission denied, try changing the permission then run again:
```bash
> chmod +x autograde.sh
```

## ImplementationToTest Folder
The folder contains an implementation from a student last semester. Feel free to add more test cases, but make sure different cases stays in different folders
